UmlCanvas is an implementation around the HTML5 Canvas that allows
generation of UML diagrams. A Mediawiki extension is provided to allow
editors to just enter the commands required to generate the
diagrams. Two interfaces are provided: an OO Javascript API and a
textual DSL in the form of a UML profile for ADL, the Application
Definition Language.

WARNING: the current UmlCanvas repository is not stable. Yes, shame on me.
not even the master, I know. I'm currently migrating from our old more closed
git repositories to the open GitHub world. Some issues still need to be
addressed.

* Kickstart

$ make
...

Install the Mediawiki extension:
$ cd /var/www/htdocs/mediawiki-install-dir/extensions
$ ln -s /path/to/UmlCanvas/dist/ext/UmlCanvas
